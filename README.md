## AI-Powered English Learning Service

This project is an AI-integrated service designed to help users learn English and improve grammar skills through repetitive exposure to sentences. The goal is to make learning new words and phrases (along with their contexts) more intuitive and enjoyable.

### Key Features:

- **Personalized Content**: Users can select topics that interest them, such as movies, TV shows, or articles. Based on these choices, the AI generates relevant phrases, keeping learning engaging and context-driven.
- **Grammar Task**: A fill-in-the-blank exercise where users complete sentences by inserting the correct auxiliary verbs.
- **Chain Task**: Users receive a scrambled sentence and must rearrange the words into the correct order.
- **Word Task**: Users are presented with a sentence containing a previously learned word and asked to choose the correct answer from multiple options.

With constant repetition and engaging tasks, this service helps users solidify their understanding of English grammar and expand their vocabulary.
